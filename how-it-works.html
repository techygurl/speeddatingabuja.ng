    <h1>Pre-Dating Speed Dating / ‚ô• Speed Dating 101</h1>
    <p>Everything you need to know before attending your first event</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>Most people tell us they had a great time‚Äîeven if they didn't make a match. That said, over two-thirds of attendees do match with at least one person!</p>

    <p>Our best advice: come with no expectations. Just show up ready to meet new people in a relaxed setting. You'll feel more confident and authentic that way. You can even bring a friend along if it helps you feel more comfortable.</p>

    <p>This is about having a great night out, enjoying a stylish venue, and connecting with friendly singles. If sparks fly? Even better!</p>

    <h2>Before the Event</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Buy your ticket on our website. No need for an e-ticket ‚Äî we‚Äôll have you on the list.</li>
      <li>Mark your calendar. Show up ready to mingle.</li>
      <li>Dress casually but polished ‚Äî think after-work drinks (no flip-flops or shorts, please).</li>
      <li>Give yourself enough time to find the venue and parking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Arrival & Check-In</h2>
    <p>Show up a few minutes early. Look for our friendly Event Host who‚Äôll welcome you at the door. Just tell us your name ‚Äî we‚Äôll check you in and hand you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A name tag</li>
      <li>Your Match Sheet</li>
      <li>A pen</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We‚Äôll guide you to your seat and give clear instructions on how everything works.</p>

    <h2>The Main Event</h2>
    <p>You‚Äôll go on 5 to 10 (sometimes more) 6-minute ‚ÄúPre-Dates‚Äù with singles of the opposite gender. We try to keep the male/female ratio balanced.</p>

    <p>Each round is easygoing and fun ‚Äî talk about anything you want, but keep it light and respectful.</p>

    <p>After each mini-date, circle YES or NO on your Match Sheet depending on whether you‚Äôd like to talk to that person again. Make a quick note to help you remember (e.g., ‚Äúgreen shirt, likes bowling‚Äù).</p>

    <p>Before you leave, take a picture of your Match Sheet, then hand it to the Host.</p>

    <h2>After the Event</h2>
    <p>Within 24 hours, we‚Äôll text and email you your results. If you‚Äôve matched with someone, both of you will receive each other‚Äôs email addresses and phone numbers .</p>

    <p>You might match with one person, three, or even none. That‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs not about quantity ‚Äî it‚Äôs about quality. Some people get multiple matches on their second or third try. The more events you attend, the more likely you are to find someone special.</p>

    <h2>Then What?</h2>
    <p>That‚Äôs up to you! You‚Äôve already broken the ice with a 6-minute Pre-Date. Now it‚Äôs your move.</p>

    <p>We can't wait to see you at the next event. üíò</p>
